# Sign-up-Form

This JavaScript script is designed to enhance user experience by implementing real-time form validation. It transforms user input, ensuring that certain fields follow specific formatting rules, such as uppercase letters for names and formatted phone numbers. It also validates password entries to confirm that they match before submission.

## Features

- **Uppercase Transformation**: Automatically converts the first and last name inputs to uppercase as the user types.
- **Phone Number Formatting**: Formats the phone number input to include dashes after the third and sixth digits, improving readability.
- **Password Confirmation**: Validates that the password and confirm password fields match, providing user feedback if they do not.
- **Form Submission Control**: Prevents form submission if any input fields are invalid or if the passwords do not match.
